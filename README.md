# Google-Gen-AI-Course

These notebooks are from a Google GenAI 5-day Intensive course

1. Day 1. **Prompt Engineering**

Explored the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. Also got trained in the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction. The code lab walks us through getting started with the Gemini API and cover several prompt techniques and how different parameters impact the prompts.

2. Day 2. **Embeddings & Vectors**

Learned about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases and how they can be used to bring live or specialist data into your LLM application. Also explored their geometrical powers for classifying and comparing textual data. 

3. Day 3. **Gen AI Agents**

Agents consist of 3 things: Model, Tools & Orchestrtaion. Learned about 3 types of tools: Extensions, Functions & Data Stores. Learned how to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process. The code labs covered how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. Learned about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot, and learned how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a caf√©.

4. Day 4.
